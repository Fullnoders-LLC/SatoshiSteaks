# API Integration Development Plan for Betting Platform

## Objective
Begin the development of the API integration layer, focusing on connecting with Bitcoin network data sources like Bitnodes and the Mempool API. This layer will enable the platform to fetch real-time data necessary for betting operations.

## Steps
1. Select specific libraries and tools for API integration based on Node.js.
2. Define interfaces and classes for managing API responses and handling errors.
3. Develop initial connections to Bitnodes API and Mempool API, ensuring data can be fetched accurately and efficiently.
4. Test the API connections for reliability and response times.

## Expected Outcome
A functioning API integration layer that reliably fetches data from the Bitcoin network, laying the foundation for the betting platform's backend.
