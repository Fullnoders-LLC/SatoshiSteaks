# Backend Architecture Outline for Betting Platform

## Objective
The objective of the backend is to effectively handle interactions with Bitcoin-related data sources, process bets, and manage transactions securely.

## Components
1. API Integration Layer: To connect with Bitcoin network data sources (Bitnodes, Mempool API, etc.) and fetch real-time data.
2. Betting Logic: To process betting actions, calculate outcomes, and manage bet state.
3. Transaction Handling: To execute Bitcoin transactions with proper inscriptions for betting actions.
4. Security and Privacy Measures: To ensure all data handling and transactions are secure and user privacy is maintained.

## Technologies
- Node.js for the backend environment.
- Libraries for API integration and transaction processing.

## Next Steps
- Identify specific libraries and tools for API integration.
- Define data models and interfaces for internal process handling.
- Prototype possible integrations with selected Bitcoin APIs.
