# Bet Handling Mechanics Development Plan

## Objective
To develop the backend functionalities for processing and tracking bets on the Bitcoin network, including dealing with inscriptions in transactions, associating bets with user actions, and dynamically determining the outcomes of bets based on real-world Bitcoin network data.

## Steps
1. **CBOR Decoding Functionality**: Implement functions to decode CBOR data from Bitcoin transaction inscriptions to read bet details.
2. **Bet Tracking**: Develop a system to track bets, linking them to users' actions and the state of the Bitcoin network.
3. **Outcome Determination**: Create logic to determine outcomes of bets based on real-time and accurate information from Bitcoin network data sources.
4. **Security Protocols**: Establish protocols for secure handling of transactions and user data.

## Expected Outcome
A set of backend mechanisms capable of securely and accurately processing bets placed on the betting platform.
